# PasswordGenerator
### Project Status: Complete

##### This app is a simple easy-to-use password generator app. 
##### You are able to choose a password between 8 and 16 characters, while also choosing if you want to include numbers and special characters.
##### You are able to hide and show the password as well as copy it for ease of use when creating accounts on other sites. 

### This app will **NEVER** store passwords!

#### When you first generate a password it will automatically be hidden, you are still able to copy the hidden text without ever showing the password:
